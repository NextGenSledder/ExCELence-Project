We found some parts of the assignment frustrating (as expected). We thought our provider's code had a lot 
of issues, but that changed over time as we grew to understand it and how it worked. It also made us realize 
a lot of things we could have done differently. Every change our providers asked for that we gave them we
should have done in the first place. We should have implemented interfaces for keyframes and properties
and should have made our view less tightly coupled to our controller implementation.

Our provider's were very pleasant to work with. They were polite and had good response time. We also
felt we treated them the same way.

Overall, this course has very deeply affected us. Going into this class, we had mad imposter syndrome.
Even throughout this course, that persisted. That being said, the assignments we had, especially 5-8,
have greatly increased our confidence in our to write decent code talk about vague abstract concepts.
I think this course has made us both much much better programmers and much much better at not knowing 
what to do. We want to say thank you. To the instructors, the TAs, everyone involved. Thank you!
